<h style="font-size:40px;font-family:'segoe ui';color:blue; font-family:'arial';"> What is a Circuit?
</h></u>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:'arial';color:red;"> A circuit is a fundamental concept in the field of electrical engineering and physics. It refers to a closed loop or pathway through which electric current can flow. In essence, it is a system of interconnected components that work together to provide power and control to electrical devices.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px;font-family:'arial';color:red;"> The basic principle behind a circuit is the flow of electric current, which is the movement of electric charge. This charge is typically carried by electrons, which are negatively charged particles found in atoms. When a circuit is complete and there is an uninterrupted path for the current to flow, electrons can move through the circuit, powering various devices and performing useful functions.</p>
